Who sits where at 10gen?

The data is real as of 2012 May 2, however, we need to verify it.

This folder provides an interactive SVG web page for finding who sits where at 10gen.
The main SVG file is viewable in a browser that supports SVG (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ..., and NOT IE < IE9)
and editable in Adobe Illustrator.

seating.svg
    To view, open this file in your browser, or serve it up via web server.
    To edit, open this file in Adobe Illustrator.

    This is the main artwork file for the floorplan, with the following additional layers:
        person_directory
            page item text elements for displaying person names, id page_item_*
            page navigation buttons, id button_directory_page_*
        person_details
            text elements for displaying person info, id is canonicalized column name
                from the Employee Contact Info google doc, canonicalized ids MUST match
            skipped fields:
                Intercall Code and PIN (PIN for call owner only)
                Onsip Conference Bridge
            image placeholder for person photo from 10gen Team Pictures and Bios wiki page, id person_photo
        seats
            rect elements for each seat, id seat_*
            rect element for person without a NYC seat, id no_seat

    For each element above, the name is also an XML element id that is specifically matched
    to the JavaScript code for interaction.

personnel.js
    Personnel info composited from
        '10gen Employee Contacts - Employee Contact Info.csv'
            Employee Contact Info google doc
            https://docs.google.com/a/10gen.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiylVnAQWESRdDZwTVpST1VKaFhrSVVUcDZHaWNrYnc#gid=0
        10gen+Team+Pictures+and+Bios.html   10gen+Team+Pictures+and+Bios_files/*
            10gen Team Pictures and Bios wiki page
            https://wiki.10gen.com/display/10GEN/10gen+Team+Pictures+and+Bios
        seat.csv
            addendum of seat number to person mapping, currently random
            This should be added as a column to the google doc

personnel_js.js
    JavaScript for SVG interaction in web browser.
    SVG implementations seem quirky and painful, I have yet to figure out
    fully-functional text elements and CSS style inserted with JavaScript.
    Help is welcome.

Rakefile
    Tasks to make personnel.js, to build, you need Ruby installed, then:
        bundle install
        rake
    If you update the google doc, wiki page, or seat.csv, you must update
    the local copy in this directory, and reissue the 'rake' command.

personnel.rb
    Ruby program to composite personnel.js from the data sources
    Entries from the wiki page that don't exactly match a google doc entry
    are output as a warning to standard error.  The wiki page entry should be
    updated to fix this mismatch.

jquery-1.7.2.min.js
    jQuery library

images/Unknown-person.gif
    default image for person photo


Adobe Illustrator notes

    Javascript files - to edit the script tags for including JavaScript
        Window > SVG Interactivity, upper-right pull-down menu > JavaScript Files ...

            personnel.js
            personnel_js.js

        Illustrator seems to sort them by name, so we have to rename them to order them.

        Illustrator generates font-family attributes with values like "'ArialMT'" with extra single-quotes.
        JavaScript code in personnel_js.js fixes these attribute values to "arial".

Improvements desired
    Reducing/scaling layout and imagery for best viewing in a browser.
        (1) On a typical large/HD computer monitor, 1920x1080
        (2) On a smaller laptop display, ex., 1440x900, 1366x768, 1280x800
        (3) On an iPad, 1024x768

        There doesn't appear to be a "simple" <input> solution for SVG
    use 10gen corp site directly in personnel_js.js
        need seat column update
